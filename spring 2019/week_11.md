## Notes

> I will be doing co-op since this summer, work for RPI CITI lab and A research center in China, total for 6 months. 
Though I am away, I hope the work can be continued. Hope there are people join ETA, since Frank graduate. And I will work
on it this fall. Hope before the next spring semester I can finish the ETA feature for Frank's and my approach. Plan to 
join IOS shuttle tracker group the next spring.
