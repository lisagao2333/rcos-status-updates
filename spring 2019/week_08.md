## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Last week, I have done several things.

- Add comments and fixing for the ArriveGo files.
- Literary just look through the code, and recall. 
- When actually run the code, it's a little bit unstable. I am wondering if it's the Go module problems.

## This Week's Plan

> For this week, I will
 
- Prepare for the up coming presentation, including meeting and communicating with my ETA group members,
making slide, running the code/demo. I will try to make a group rehearsal. 
- I will try to write an explanation document on writing Go module for importing data from python, which will 
work for people who newly join shuttle trucker group and prefer using python. 
- I find when at the beginning of the semester I make pull requests to the master branch, ID "houndci-bot" had 
made a lot of comments on my "calculation of the ETA for union and blitman stops #197 " file, I have not solve them. 
He almost commented on every line of my code. For example, for some Go lang specifications that 
"not using underscore when naming". This pull request is still open. Those need time to fix, I will definitely fix them this semester. And 
thank "houndci-bot" for looking through my code and giving suggestions.
