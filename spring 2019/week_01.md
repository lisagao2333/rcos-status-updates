## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Last week, as the beginning of this semester, I have done several beginner things. 

- Install the shuttle tracker local environment 
- Improve and make commit to the ETA stops calculation file to the main branch in my shuttle tracker reponsitory
- Make the pull request of the code I wrote to the wtg/shuttle tracker ETA feature
- Assign task to each member in ETA feature group meeting. My short-term goal is to make calculation of the "Relative Velocity"

## This Week's Plan

> For this week. I will start to work on the "relative velocity", which stands for: the amount of vehicles minus one, then \ 
multiply by the average, then add the current velocity, finally the sum divided by the amount of vehicle. I will do the following \ 
things to achieve this final goal step by step.
- Write a documentation to explain our algorithm which derived from an Indian article.
- Review the https://shuttles.rpi.edu/history endpoint and take the data as json file


## Anything Blocking?

> Acquire the real time data from the database.


## Notes
