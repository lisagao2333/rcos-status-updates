## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Last week, I have done several things.
 
- Spring break actually is the next week, so I still did something.
- Watch a video on Youtube on how to add images in MD file, such as readme.md. The link for this video is 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvPOUdz5PL4 . I was always considering adding proper images in readme files or weekly 
status files. Proper images will help the readers to better understand what the author want to explain. Last semester, 
I have written something on improving the user experience when they run the shuttle tracker local environment, such as
make the page automatically refresh when adding new js files(shuttle information). And I want to put some images to show 
the difference. I upload my images to google drive then paste the link to my weekly status updates, which make the updates 
file looks un-organized. So this year when I want to add some images again I want to seek some ways that make the images 
right on the file, instead of just links. So I watch a youtube video to learn and try to write it down, Explain it in a 
concise way.
- Write a distance_explanation.md file documentation with images inserted, for explaining the algorithm that I use to 
find the total distance 
of each route, and find the distance between the current location and the next stop for a single shuttle. Then I can use 
the real time distance information and the real time relative velocity to find the estimated time of arrival for each 
shuttle for the nearest stop. The code was written in go lang the last semester. This file is with the distance.go file 
in the same folder.
- Write a relative_velocity_explanation.md file documentation with images inserted, to explain the algorithm I used to
calculate the relative velocity, the definition of relative velocity, and the comparision between relative velocity and 
the real time velocity. The code was written this semester in python. This file is with the relative_velocity.py file 
in the same folder.
- Start to write the calculation file one ETA stops in python. 

## This Week's Plan

> For this week, I will 
- Enjoy the spring break. 
- Write the documentations on how to insert images in md file. Though easy, I think will be very helpful for writing 
documentations, if possible in the spring break.
- Continue to work on the ETA for each shuttle stop, if possible in the spring break.
