## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Last week, I have done several things.
 
- Spring break actually is the next week, so I still did something.
- Watch a video on Youtube on how to add images in MD file, such as readme.md. The link for this video is 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvPOUdz5PL4 . I was always considering adding proper images in readme files or weekly 
status files. Proper images will help the readers to better understand what the author want to explain. Last semester, 
I have written something on improving the user experience when they run the shuttle tracker local environment, such as
make the page automatically refresh when adding new js files(shuttle information). And I want to put some images to show 
the difference. I upload my images to google drive then paste the link to my weekly status updates, which make the updates 
file looks un-organized. So this year when I want to add some images again I want to seek some ways that make the images 
right on the file, instead of just links. So I watch a youtube video to learn and try to write it down, Explain it in a 
concise way.
- Write the documentations on how to insert images in md file. 
- Place proper images in my previous files that help understanding. 
- Start to write the calculation file one ETA stops in python. 

## This Week's Plan
