## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Last week, 

- Further analysis the history data.
- Do some coding to analysis and make a commit.

## This Week's Plan

> For this week, I plan to do several things:

- Fix the "Blitman and Union Stop" go file pull request which is still opened
- Fix another opened pull request

## Anything Blocking?

> Workload for the next semester, or the next spring. I am away for the fall semester and not attend the summer arch. My partner Frank is graduating this semester. Shin will be keeping working on notifications, and his partner is leaving. 

## Notes

> I was roughly add up the history speed data and divide by the number of data, to get average speed for each shuttle. 
We have 11 shuttles in operation and I get 11 average speed, without further analysis and sorting. However, that is not 
precise. This week I re-arrange all the data. I find there are some imperfections for the history data. While other shuttles
have tons of data, the 8th shuttle only have 7 data. And only 2 of the 7 speed data are over 5 miles/hour. The average
speed for the 8th shuttle is only about 2.77 miles/hour, which is far behind the average speeds of other shuttles. Also, the history data can be sorted by ride on different routes and different time periods of the day.
