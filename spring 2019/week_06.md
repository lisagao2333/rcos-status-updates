## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Last week, I have done several things.
 - Finish the python backend, and the go lang module to export the data from python file 
 - Commit the main program file to Git. (Will commit the rest part to Git this weekend.)

## This Week's Plan

> For this week, I will 
- Still on testing and improving. 
- Write a complete documentation about how the backend work. Will be included in the ArriveGo folder. 
- Add comments for the code file, to help understanding each part.


## Anything Blocking?

> There is a problem, which is still related to the history endpoint. The history endpoint is not stable. Sometimes, it 
can not show the page. So, when the program is working, if the request for getting data from the history endpoint is failed, 
the program will automatically run again to request data. 


## Notes

> None.
