## Last Week's Accomplishments

>Last week, I have done several things.
- Testing the code
- Write the explanation documents "ArriveGo Explanation". It's in the "ArriveGo" folder.

## This Week's Plan

> For this week, I will 
- Add comments for programs in "ArriveGo" Folder


## Anything Blocking?

> Something blocking is I wrote the code without applying the environment. I did not update 
the local shuttle tracker, while I use pycharm and vim to write. Today I download Gogland 
Jetbrain and will download other Go lang IDE to test the "not working well" go module. 
I will do the final testing with my group-mates to revise. 


## Notes

> None.
