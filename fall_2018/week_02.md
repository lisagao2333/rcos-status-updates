## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Hi, I use notepad to write status update. All the text are in the single line so I forget to write "Plan for this week". Sorry about that I did not notice. For the last week, I install the shuttle tracker package in my windows laptop. After setting up the environment, I did some learning on go script, since I am really not familiar with the language. I also try to look through some code that already push to Github. Try to familiar with it.The last week, I have one big exam that takes up 25% percent of the course grade, so I worked hard on it.

## This Week's Plan

> For this week, I plan to actually run the entire thing once and look through the ETA code that pushed to Git the last semester. I think I will get inspirations from it. And For this week i will start to write some code for it.> Examples: I will look throught code about ETA people did for the last semester.

## Anything Blocking?

> I really lack of experience that actually work for a project, it is my first time. Feel a little bit nervious. I afraid that I don't work well.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
