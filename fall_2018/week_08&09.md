## Last Week's Accomplishments

> For the last 2 weeks I did nothing almost. i talk to frank that my code for distance was right. I have way behind my plan. 

## This Week's Plan

> I have way behind my plan. For the rest 2 weeks, I will speed up. I will finish write the eta part. Since using relative velocity was so complicated, I would rather use the current speed. I will take an average of the current speed and use it to calculate estimate times. And I for the last week I will start to implement the frontend. 
## Anything Blocking?

> Nope. The only thing blocking me is time. I am way behind my plan.>
