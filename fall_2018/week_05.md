## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, I did a lot. I have put the routes and stops 's raw data in the local shuttle tracker. Though have trouble to access the local admin, I wrote the code to calculate the length of the west, east, and night route, relatively. The west route is about 2.34 miles, east is about 4.2, the night route is about 7 miles. I keep 15 digits for decimal parts. And then I double check--since there will be one shuttle per 15 minutes, I did the math, and find out the speed of the shuttle is about 12 miles/h. And I am waiting for my teammate to find out the relative velocity--by the complex equation he found. The value he found probably will be close to the value i find. I have open  a new branch and commit my code to git.

## This Week's Plan

> I will re-install local shuttle tracker. And make my code run in it. my code is work when I run it in terminals. 
## Anything Blocking?

>I have successfully run my local shuttle tracker. Thanks to beiqi that help me to build the environment at the begining, however, it does not work now. beiqi has try her best to make it work, but it shows that some files may lost--anyway, the postgress that I already download disappeared. I can not access local shuttle tracker. So I need to start over to install the environment.>
