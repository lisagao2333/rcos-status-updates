## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week I did something. I calculate the average velocity for the past 7 days by simplely just add them up and divide. I talk to Frank, find he did better than me. He has collect the past 30 days' data and then caculate the average velocity for each week days. I will further revise my code... do better. Also, another thing I do is further apply the go code I wrote for calculate distance. I did for the front end. That the three length for west, east, and night, can shown in the local shuttle.  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_3RiEf02vSC9QCQQvuqO22gzxOUqeemf
I am keeping doing the final step--calculate arival time due to the next stop. If I can work out some thing, I will commit, if not then not.

## This Semester's Summery
> This semester, did a lot of reading and google searching for learning the new things. Go language, js, vue, install local shuttle tracker, run it, deal with the crash, reinstall, read through the code.
I successfully write the code to calculate the distance for west, east, and night routes in go. 
I fix two bugs in admin.
I apply my distance result to the frontend. 


## Next Semester's Plan

> Syncing my responsitory to the wtg responsitory.
Pull my all changes to the wtg responsitory.
