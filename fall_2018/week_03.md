## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, I contacted my 2 teammates who are also doing ETAs. However, one of them droped the class. I meet Frank, and we talked about what we already knew and our plans for ETA. I talked about my idea that since our webpage is based on Openstreet Map, and for open street map, it can actually calculate the time used to drive or walk from one point to another point. So we can simplely take the time out, plus the current time, and then we have the eta times. I did have a plan, but then i found Frank had a better idea that train our skills. He also wrote down his plan step by steps and for this this semester we will finish the first 2 steps. I read an article that calculate the eta times, ---no longer use openstreet map. And then we made the presentation slides and prepare for presenting. ## This Week's Plan

> This week, after our presentation, two people from the notification group came to talk to us and join us, since what we did are actually very similar. We create the group on Groupme. And as we presented, this week's task for us is to implement the new endpoint. We four will do this together. It will be at shuttles.rpi.edu/history.
